				A MedicationOrder document is created every time that a medication is "ordered", meaning that it is

				medications). A MedicationOrder document should relate to its MedicationFIll document using the
				"medicationFill" relationship type and to its HealthActionSchedule (MedicationSchedule for now)
				documents using the "healthActionSchedule" relationship type.
