				It is common to schedule health action plans. The HealthActionSchedule allows a simple
				schedule for a HealthActionPlan to be created with simple recurrence rules using specifications similar to
				standard calendar entries. In order to create more complex schedules, for example a steroid taper,
				multiple HealthActionSchedule documents would need to be created. The HealthActionSchedule should be related
				from the appropriate HealthActionPlan using the ?healthActionSchedule? relationship type and to the
				appropriate HealthActionOccurrence documents using the ?healthActionOccurrence? relationship type.
				Eventually we should use the complete iCal standard. An xml format is in development
