  now it's 1 SWC for everyone and you have to initialize the lib by code
- updated libraries dependencies
  now we reuse core.swc, logd.swc, etc. from the project maashaack
  see:
   http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/wiki/core
   http://code.google.com/p/maashaack/wiki/logd

* 0.7.0.177

  instead of having different project roots
  as GA-AS3, GA_Flex, GA_Flash
  we keep all under one root
  easier for maintenance and code sync
- Full component architecture
  based on AnalyticsTracker
  we have
  FlashTracker (analytics_flash.swc, Flash CS3 visual component)
  FlexTracker (analytics_flex.swc, Flex 3 visual component)
  GATrackerLibrary/GATracker (analytics.swc, AS3 code library)
- fix bug with HTMLDOM cacheproperties
- fix bug with visual debug compiled in Flex
- added component logo

* 0.6.0.137
- Event Tracking added
- EventInfo works as DocumentInfo etc.

  of EvenTracker to automate their repetitive even tracking

* 0.6.0.134
- Flex SWC tested, be careful the namespace are not showing
  in the syntax completion (cf: com.google.analytics.core.as3_api)
- use "ant help" for the documentation of the build

* 0.6.0.132
